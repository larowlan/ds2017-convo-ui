## Live Demo!

What could possibly go wrong?

---

## Terminology

Note:
- so let's go over some of the terminology we're going to cover

--

## Intents

Note:
- mapping what the user says into an action
- 'Order some pizza?'
- 'What is the wait time?'

--

## Entities

Note:
- familiar w/ from Drupal
- basically the same
- collection of objects
- synonyms

--

## Context

Note:
- conversation is threaded
- humans keep track
- 'play something by Kurt Ville'
- 'give me another one'

--

## Fulfillment

Note:
- Dynamic responses
- Where Drupal fits in

---

## Design considerations

Note:
- So conversation is hard
- You need to plan
- Nothing worse than poor UX/ rabbit holes

--

## You need to think about

- Scope
- Personality
- Flow
